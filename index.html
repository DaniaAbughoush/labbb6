        Just let him be his perfect self, sans clothing. Additionally, it's never a good idea to keep 
        your cat in clothing for very long, especially warm clothing such as sweaters. Even in chilly weather, 
        it's dangerous to put a sweater on Mr. Mittens and keep it on him for a long period of time

        Because so many cats do, emphatically, mind wearing clothes; there is nothing in their genetic 
        template or life experiences 
        to lead them to ever ever conclude this is a life-enhancing activity.

        Another great alternative to a cone for cats is baby clothes. Whether it's an adorable flannel or just a onesie, these are great way to keep your cat protected while their injury heals. Most cats are a 3-6mo or 6-9mo size and these can work great when you need to cover their legs.
